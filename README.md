# Delete User Functionality: Authentication and Authorization Analysis

## Introduction

The delete user functionality implemented in this project is secured by both authentication and authorization checks. In this explanation, we evaluate whether requiring authentication for this feature is a good or bad idea and explore the key differences between authentication and authorization.

## Is Requiring Authentication for Deleting Users a Good Idea?

### Good Idea: Yes!

**Authentication** is crucial for verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Requiring authentication before allowing any delete action is a good idea because it ensures that only legitimate users can initiate sensitive operations. Without authentication, anyone could submit a delete request, potentially resulting in malicious actions like deleting accounts arbitrarily.

### Why Authentication Is Necessary

1. **Security**: Without verifying the identity of the person initiating the delete request, the system would be vulnerable to attacks, allowing unauthorized deletions.
2. **Accountability**: By requiring authentication, every delete action is tied to a verified user, making it easier to track and audit actions.

**Overall Conclusion**: Requiring authentication for delete functionality is not just a good idea; it is essential for ensuring the security and integrity of the application.

## Why Authorization Matters After Authentication

While authentication verifies identity, **authorization** ensures that even authenticated users can only perform actions they have permissions for. For example, a regular user might not have the authority to delete another userâ€™s account. Authorization layers add control over what actions an authenticated user can execute.

## Authentication vs. Authorization: Key Differences

- **Authentication** is about verifying identity: "Who are you?"
- **Authorization** is about verifying permissions: "What can you do?"

Both are essential for protecting sensitive operations like deleting users, but they serve distinct roles in the overall security model.

### Conclusion

Requiring authentication for deleting users is a best practice, as it prevents unauthorized deletions and ensures that only verified users can attempt such actions. Additionally, pairing it with authorization ensures that even authenticated users are restricted based on their permissions, leading to a secure and reliable system.

Here's a simple flowchart to visualize the process:

                +-----------------+

                +-----------------+
                          |
                          v
                +-----------------+
                | Authentication  |
                +-----------------+
                    | Success |
                    v         v
            +------------------+  Failed 
            | Authorization    |<--|
            +------------------+
                    |
                    v
         +-----------------------------+
         | Delete User Action Allowed  |

# Environment Setup

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend

Install the necessary packages:
npm install

Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder and include the following environment variables:
TOKEN_KEY=your_secret_key
PORT=4001

Replace your_secret_key with a secure string for the TOKEN_KEY.
Set the PORT variable as needed (default is 4001).

Start the server:
npm start

Frontend Setup

For running the frontend:

Open the frontend folder in VS Code.

Use the Live Server extension to run the frontend:

Install the "Live Server" extension if you haven't already.
Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

Your frontend should now be running locally, and you can interact with the delete user functionality.
