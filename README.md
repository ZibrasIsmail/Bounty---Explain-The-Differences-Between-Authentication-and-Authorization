# Delete User Functionality: Authentication and Authorization Analysis

## Introduction

The delete user functionality implemented in this project is secured by both authentication and authorization checks. In this explanation, we will evaluate whether requiring authentication for this feature is a good or bad idea and dive into the key differences between authentication and authorization.

## Why Authentication Is Important for Deleting Users

### Clarity

Authentication verifies that a user is who they claim to be. Without authentication, anyone could attempt to delete a user by submitting a request, potentially leading to unauthorized and malicious deletions. By requiring authentication, we ensure that only logged-in users can interact with this feature, reducing the risk of such scenarios.

### Relevance

In this context, the delete user functionality allows for controlled access. If no authentication is enforced, it opens the door to major security vulnerabilities. Users could be deleted without verification of the requester’s identity, creating chaos in the system. Authentication, coupled with authorization, is necessary to maintain a secure environment.

### Structure

To clearly understand why authentication is critical, let's break down the process:

1. **Authentication**: This step verifies the user's identity (e.g., checking if a user is logged in).
2. **Authorization**: This step checks whether the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the delete action (e.g., is the user an admin, or does the user have sufficient privileges?).

Both steps ensure that only legitimate requests are processed.

### Depth of Analysis

While authentication ensures the user is who they claim to be, authorization further refines access control. Authorization focuses on determining what actions a user can perform based on their role or permissions. In this case, we authorize users to delete only specific accounts (or even restrict this action to admins). By having both processes in place, we minimize risks:

- Unauthorized users cannot delete accounts because they won’t pass the authentication step.
- Even if authenticated, users cannot delete accounts they are not allowed to, thanks to authorization checks.

By combining authentication and authorization, the system is safeguarded from both external threats and internal misuse.

## Authentication vs. Authorization: Key Differences

- **Authentication** is about verifying identity. It answers the question: "Who are you?"
- **Authorization** is about verifying permissions. It answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?"

Both are essential for protecting sensitive operations like deleting users, but they serve distinct roles in the overall security model.

### Conclusion

Requiring authentication for deleting users is a best practice, as it prevents unauthorized deletions and ensures that only verified users can attempt such actions. Additionally, pairing it with authorization ensures that even authenticated users are restricted based on their permissions, leading to a secure and reliable system.

# Environment Setup

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend

Install the necessary packages:
npm install

Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder and include the following environment variables:
TOKEN_KEY=your_secret_key
PORT=4001

Replace your_secret_key with a secure string for the TOKEN_KEY.
Set the PORT variable as needed (default is 4001).

Start the server:
npm start

Frontend Setup

For running the frontend:

Open the frontend folder in VS Code.

Use the Live Server extension to run the frontend:

Install the "Live Server" extension if you haven't already.
Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

Your frontend should now be running locally, and you can interact with the delete user functionality.
